			<p>
				I'm an ISTP personality type. But I've been more extroverted and introverted depending on when I took the test.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also speedrun minesweeper, which means I try to beat the expert board as fast as possible. My fastest time is 66 seconds.
			</p>
			<p>
				I listen to a lot of music. Last year I listened to 90,000 minutes of music, which is about 1,500 hours.
			</p>
			<p>
				I went to Rolling Loud the hip hop festival over spring break. This is a picture from my favorite rapper Babytron, he's from Ypsilanti.
